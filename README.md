A heavy modification of @jpweller's boilerplate.

## TODOs:

### known issues

If grunt-contrib-imagmin fails to install properly because of pngquant see [issue](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin/issues/183/#issuecomment-41841391)

If still no luck then comment out the task use something else. But just before you do, try it once more. Worked for me :P
